        <p class="section-p"><code>Irish traditional music</code> began as an oral tradition, passed on from generation to generation by listening, learning by ear, and without formally writing the tunes on paper. This is a practice that is still encouraged today and students of traditional music are encouraged to pick up tunes they hear from others or to learn as they listen.</p>
        <p class="section-p">The traditional music played by the Irish came to the country with the Celts 2,000 years ago. The Celts were influenced by the music of the East and it’s believed that the traditional Irish harp may in fact have originated in Egypt.</p>
        <p class="section-p">Singers and instrumentalists often embellish melodies through ornamentation. </p>  
        <p class="section-p">Amongst the instruments that I have written about, here are some more popular ones;</p>

      <section id="Flute" class="main-section"> 
        <header class="section-header">Flute</header>
        <p class="section-p">An Irish flute is a simple-system flute made of wood (typically African blackwood, cocus, rosewood, boxwood, and ebony). These conical-bore flutes were originally used by concert musicians before the adoption of the Boehm system flutes in the middle of the 19th century. As the simple-system flutes were discarded by concert flutists, folk and traditional musicians adopted them. A number of makers produce Irish flutes today, most commonly out of wood, but also out of more modern materials like Delrin and PVC.</p>
        <p class="section-p">Matt Molloy, an Irish flautist, is considered one of the countries most spectacular musicians. His style, that adapts piping techniques to the flute has influenced many contemporary Irish flute players.</p>

      <section id="Fiddle" class="main-section">
        <header class="section-header">Fiddle</header>
        <p class="section-p">One of the most important instruments in the traditional repertoire, the fiddle (or violin – there is no physical difference) is played differently in widely varying regional styles. It uses the standard GDAE tuning. The best-known regional fiddling traditions are from Donegal, Sligo, Sliabh Luachra and Clare.</p>
   <p class="section-p"> The fiddle has ancient roots in Ireland, The earliest reference to the fiddle in Ireland was during the 7th century by O'curry. The first Irish fiddles were mass manufactured by John Neal along with his brother William in Dublin during 1720s. An instrument was excavated during the 18th century in Dublin that was dated from the 11th century, it was made of dogwood with an animal carved on its tip, it was believed to have been the oldest bow in the world.</p>

      <section id="Banjo" class="main-section">
        <header class="section-header">Banjo</header>
        <p class="section-p">The banjo is a stringed instrument with a thin membrane stretched over a frame or cavity to form a resonator. The membrane is typically circular, and usually made of plastic, or occasionally animal skin.</p>
        <p class="section-p">The four-string tenor banjo is played as a melody instrument by Irish traditional players, and is commonly tuned GDAE, an octave below the fiddle. It was brought to Ireland by returned emigrants from the United States, where it had been developed by African slaves. It is seldom strummed in Irish music (although older recordings will sometimes feature the banjo used as a backing instrument), instead being played as a melody instrument using either a plectrum or a "thimble".</p>

      <section id="Harp" class="main-section">
        <header class="section-header">Harp</header>
        <p class="section-p">The harp is among the chief symbols of Ireland. The Celtic harp, seen on Irish coinage and used in Guinness advertising, was played as long ago as the 10th century. In ancient times, the harpers were greatly respected and, along with poets and scribes, assigned a high place amongst the most significant retainers of the old Gaelic order of lords and chieftains.</p>
        <p class="section-p">Perhaps the best known representative of this tradition of harping today is Turlough Ó Carolan, a blind 18th century harper who is often considered the unofficial national composer of Ireland. Thomas Connellan, a slightly earlier Sligo harper, composed such well known airs as "The Dawning of the Day"/"Raglan Road" and "Carolan's Dream".</p>
        <p class="section-p">The harp continues to occupy a niche in Irish traditional music, mainly for solo instrumental performance, or as the only accompaniment for an individual singer. Its melodic foreground role and background accompaniment role as a plucked or strummed string instrument has been subsumed by guitar, mandolin, and Irish bouzouki, etc., in ensemble performance.</p>

      <section id="Mandolin" class="main-section">
        <header class="section-header">Mandolin</header>
        <p class="section-p">The mandolin has become a common instrument amongst Irish traditional musicians. Fiddle tunes are readily accessible to the mandolin player because of the equivalent range of the two instruments and the practically identical (allowing for the lack of frets on the fiddle) left hand fingerings.</p>

      <section id="Uilleann_Pipes" class="main-section">
        <header class="section-header">Uilleann Pipes</header>
        <p class="section-p">The uilleann pipes are the characteristic national bagpipe of Ireland. Earlier known in English as "union pipes", their current name is a partial translation of the Irish language terms píobaí uilleann (literally, "pipes of the elbow"), from their method of inflation. </p>
        <p class="section-p">Uilleann pipes are among the most complex forms of bagpipes; they possess a chanter with a double reed and a two-octave range, three single-reed drones, and, in the complete version known as a full set, a trio of (regulators) all with double reeds and keys worked by the piper's forearm, capable of providing harmonic support for the melody. </p>

      <section id="Concertina" class="main-section">
        <header class="section-header">Concertina</header>
        <p class="section-p">A concertina is a free-reed musical instrument, like the various accordions and the harmonica. It consists of expanding and contracting bellows, with buttons (or keys) usually on both ends, unlike accordion buttons, which are on the front.
          The concertina was developed independently in both England and Germany.</p>
          <p class="section-p">Concertinas are manufactured in several types, the most common in Irish traditional music being the Anglo system with a few musicians now playing the English system. Each differs from the other in construction and playing technique. The most distinctive characteristic of the Anglo system is that each button sounds a different note, depending on whether the bellows are compressed or expanded.</p>
